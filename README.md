# What is ULM?
ULM (United Language Model)
A ULM is a technique that combines multiple large language models (LLMs) specializing in different domains to create a customized chatbot. This approach offers several benefits:
 * Cost-effectiveness: By using smaller, more affordable models for specific tasks (e.g., GPT-4o mini for chatting), ULM can be more cost-effective than using a single, large model for all purposes.
 * Efficiency: LLMs can focus on their areas of expertise, leading to more accurate and efficient responses.
 * Customization: ULMs can be tailored to meet specific needs and requirements.
Example: A ULM might combine:
 1. GPT-4o mini for general chat and conversation.
 2. GPT-4 latest for complex tasks like math problem-solving and critical thinking.
 3. Claude 3.5 sonnet for coding-related requests.
By combining these models, the ULM can provide a powerful and versatile chatbot capable of handling a wide range of tasks.

# Benefits of ULM:
* we can customize our own model and enhance its skills in specific domains.
 * ULM is more cost-effective and practical to use.
 * It can handle a wide range of tasks efficiently by combining various LLMs.
 * It will provide more accurate responses if we choose the perfect LLMs to combine.
 * It can grow with evaluations of models. This means that in the future, when LLMs become more effective, we can create even more powerful models with ULM.
